There has always been some friction between smokers and non—smokers, But
lately this friction has grown more heated.
, The controversy has been fueled by questionable reporls which claim that
“second-hand smoke" is a cause ofserious diseases among non—smokers.
But, in fad, there is little evidenceﬂmd certainly nothing which prams
scienhﬁcally—Mtigumm smoke W5 disease in nonsmokers
Skepticsmightalldristhewishﬁilthinkingofalobacoo oompany Butoonsicler
the scientiﬁc judgment of some of the leading authorities in lhe ireldfinduding
outspokencritics ofsmoking.
l ' For example, in 1983 the organizer ofan international conference on environ—
‘ mental tobacco smoke (HTS) summarized the evidence on lung cameras follows:
"An overall evaluation based upon available scientiﬁc dam leads to thc conclusion
that an increased risk for nonsmokers from 1218 exposure has not been
established.”
Even the chief statistician of die American Cancer Society, Lawrence
Garfinkel, has gone on record as saying, “passive smoking may be a political
matter, but it is nota main issue in terms of health policy!"
Which brings us back no our original point: cigarette smoke can be very
annoyingto nonvsmokersr
But how shall we asasociety deal With this problem?
Confrontation? Segregation? Legislation?
No. We mink annoyance is neither a gavemmen'al problem nor a medical
pmhlem. Its zi people problem.
Smokers and non—smokers have to talk to one another. Not yell, preach,
threaten, hadgeror bully Talk.
Smokers can help by being more considemm and responsible. Non-smokers
can help by being more tolerant. And both groups can help by showing more
IESpCct for each omer's rigits and feelings. ,
But elirninaling rumor and rhetoricwill help most oiall.
Because when you stick lollie fans, its a lot easier to deal wilh me friction. g
