Who amyou kidding?
The newspapers and magazines and billboards are ﬁlled with
cigarette ads. Kids cfm’lhel/y balm them. '
How am you expect us lo believe you're not trying 10 reach and
inﬂuence ourchildmt?
Wake not surprised it many people feel this way~cspecially when
years of negative publictly have made them totally cynical about our
industry.
Nevertheless. we'd like to set the record strand“.
First otall, we don’twanlyoungpeoplc tosmoke. And we're running
ads aimed speciﬁcally at young people advising them that we think
) smoking is strictly for adults,
Second, research shows that amongal] the factors that can inﬂuence
a young person to start smoking, advertising is insignificant. Kids just
don'tpayattention to cigarette ads. and thats exactly as it should be.
Finally—and this is sometimes hard for people outside the market-
ing ﬁeld to understand—all of our cigarette ads are whatwe call "brand
advertising." Its purpose is to get smokers of competitive products to
switch to one of our brands, and to build the loyalty of those who already
smoke one at our brands.
At the present themare some 200 dilfcrcnt cigarette brands forsale
in the U5 Many of them have only a very small fraction of the total
cigarette market Getting smokers to switch is virtually the only way a
ciwette brand can meaningfully increase its business,
Thats why we don’t advertise to young people.
Of course, if you‘d llkc to sham this ad Wllil your childmn, that would
be just fine with us.
