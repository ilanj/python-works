the mawmyt including several restaurant owners, spoke against the proposed smoking

smoking bans, the board said they would allow the restaurant owners to come up with a

compromise and present it to the board at two public hearlngs in January Final

iesotuh‘on is expected in early February. We have activated smokers and restaurant

lorthelhree BOH meetings held onthis issue.
