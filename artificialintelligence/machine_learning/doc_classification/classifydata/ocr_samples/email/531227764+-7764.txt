Adminlscxatlon (sum does not have the authority to

requ1ete the design, manufacture or marketing of Cigarettes

under its exxsllng charteri

or a medical deuce under the Federal Fond, Drug and

Cosmetic Act," said chntlee A: Blixt, executive nice

president and general counsel of Reynalds Tobacco. "Nhile

we are wining to begin a die1oo with Congress on

reasonable options for additional regulation of the design

and manufacture of clqarettes at the federal level, it is

cieat that the mm charter currently does not give it the
