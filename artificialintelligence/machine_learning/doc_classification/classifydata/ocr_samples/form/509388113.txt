asazmves:
(iii Tn determine if an overall perceptuai difference is found between
a CAMEL Light as if configured urototyoe made with a cAiitL Light
hiended tahaeco that has been douhie water extracted with and
without re-appiied denieotinized tooaeeo extrictt (LNAIO: vs.
LNAmf)
(2). To determine if an overaii oerceotuai difference is found between
a CAHEL Light as VF configured prototype made with a cam Light
hiend and an Agriculturai Research Low nicotine (AR Lii) grown
tooaceo hiend, hoth hiends processed with douhie water
extraction. (LNAIOe vst LNAng)
The main goai of the inn project is to reduce the hiend nicotine ievei by six
. and to deveioo orotoceots with acceptahie taste for marketing by August 1.
IEB9. This sensnry test wiii heio determine whether (1) the type of tobacco
blend used (CAMEL Light vx. AR LN) or (2) the re-apoiication of denicotinized
extract effect an email difference, This is secnnd in a series of sensory
tests to aid oroduct deueiopers in project direction, Results from this study
um he used to seieet prototyoeis) for ﬂavor deueiopnent.
