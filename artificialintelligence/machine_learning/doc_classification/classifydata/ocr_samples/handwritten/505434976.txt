KILL MILLIONS 1
To replace doomed smokers who‘sicken and die;
The Merchants of Death scheme to survive;
For without a constant stream of new addicts,
The Tobacco Industry know they've ”had it."
So despite their whimpering and whining,
The facts clearly show there's no denying; ‘
Cigarette makers' motives are not at all pure;
Their ads are plainly planned to be sure
That gullible and naive kids will be induced,
To believe that smoking cigarettes will produce:
Athletic prowess, health, success, happiness; 5-
Elegant status, popularity and all the rest. 5 ,

Hook them now; young, inexperienced and before 3‘ ‘
They're older, wiser — aware of the real score“
Cigarettes, No. 1 health problem, a tragedy indeed,
Leads only to Cancer, Emphysema and Heart Diseasei I
