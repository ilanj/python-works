Dear Hrs. Cohen:
Thank you in: your recent letcez‘
The tar anz’ nicotine readings shown on our canton package
are based on our own analyses during the mast recent test
period prior to the nnnuﬁacture of the cigarettaq in the
package. Currently the package status averaged nu
more than tilt 5 IN; ... pet ciqaratte, nicotine.- 0.5 mg ..4
per cigarette". The phrase "no more than" indicates that
the actual readings could be less than those shown on the
‘ pack. ‘Fne advertisement that you mention shows ms.
Government figure: for Carltwn Filter to be 4 Inq tar and
0.3 m; nﬁcotins. Thus, whilQ we can adjust: our advertising
frequently te reflect the latest: (overnment figures, we
cannot chatqs our package as readily and the “nu more than"
serves a distinct purpose.
Carlton 7U‘s, n shorter cigarette {the size of Lucky strike),
15 available only in the Washington, ms” area.
Your interest in writing to us is appreciated. '
ﬁirwetely,
N. W. Dnhrenburg
