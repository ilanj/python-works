Because the tobacco and health controversy has increasingly
focused on women and smoking, 1 am enclesing a new Tobacco
Institute publication which addresses this issue. I hope you
will find a way to make your membership aware of its contents
— and its availability, free of charge, from The Tobacco lnstitute.
Whether it be the issue of women and smoking, or any of the other
controversies surrounding the use of tobacco products. we sin-

' cerely believe that a full, free and informed discussion of the
issues is in the public's best interest. We agree with the '
American Cancer Society's conviction that. "adult individuals
must make up their own minds about smoking, but it requires that
individuals know the facts,"

For too long. adversaries of tobacco have attempted [0 influence
those adult personal decisions, as well as public policy, with
assumptions. opinions or conjectures not supported by scientific
or medical facts.

FACT @ FANCY? was produced to present more factual. and balanced,
answers o‘lTn t e health question about which mature women need

to know more.

If we may provide any further information to you or your members.
please contact me. 1 have included our toll—free telephone
number for the use of anyone desiring additional information

or a copy of this publication.

Additionally, we have spukesmsn»-and women—who are available

to address club meetings and conventions to present the facts
and answer questions.

sincerely.
