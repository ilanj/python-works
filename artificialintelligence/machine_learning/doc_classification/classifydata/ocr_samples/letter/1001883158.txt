I have forwsrded under separate eover the three eons of unmarked of;
filter orgsrettes, which were mentioned in Dr. selignsn's letter {
of February 1, 1955. for use in your experimental program. W.
The cigarettes are typical of the popular class uslrg cellulose I
, soetste filters and hsve been selected so so to he relatively }\
uniform in weight and in resistance to gas flow. The eonposl. 1
tion of the smoke from s cigarette is dependent on its water ./
content. These have been equilihreteo to constant werght under on
standard oonoitlons (71+? and 60; relative humidity). it is (
suggested that the eigsrettes he kept sealed and preferably u
refrigerated at about we until neededr Transfer to s closed z
container sftsr opening the sons will also help preserve their x ;
uniformity. { R
Routine anslytlosl data on these samples is now in progress and luff;
should be available in the near future. Aodltlonel enslyses J
or the smoke will be ohtslneo ss is suggested by future work in
this Area. R
we have not as yet stsrted work with the lung surroetont samples i \\
that you so kindly sent us. I hope this can be done lo the near ;
future. p , ye;
may I thank you again for the very interesting and lnromatlve 8
visit you made us lest month end I look forward to nrrther p.
