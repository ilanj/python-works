To the Editor:
In "Lung Association Responds,” thugust 14, was), hr. James
Swnmlsy of the American Lung Association compares again the
addictxan of tshscco to the addiction of drugs such ss heroin
and cocaine.
A fact even the most vociferous anti—snaking groups cannot
deny is that over 40 miiiion Americans have stopped smokinqr
The majority of which am so without formal cessatiun
progrens. And those are not our numbers, they are the
surgeon General's.
Tc compare the drug addiction of crack or heroin users to
that of cigarettes is to trivisiize the real and very sericus
drug prohiem Americe faces.
sincerely,
