Dear Professor iiero:
We would like to ask you a few questions regarding your recently published amcle
”Why Review Articles on the Health Effects or Passive Smoking Reach Different
Conclusiuns” ournal of be American Medical Association volume 279, Number
19, pages 1566-1570, May 20, |998]. " ’ ' ‘
First, as summarized in your Table 3, the relationship between ~article conclusions"
and ”author afﬁliations“ was examined You conclude rhai ”review articles are
strongly associated with the afﬁliations of their authors~ Two types or author
afﬁliations were considered in your publications: ”tobacco-afﬁliated authors" and
”non-tobaceoalﬁliated Rumors.“ Did you also examine but not publish the
statistical relauonships between any other author afﬁliation classiﬁcarlon, in
particular, “tobacco control-afﬁliated authors” and "amide conclusion”? ll 50, would
you kindly provide the results of those analysesi
Second, you list nve criteria lor classifying authors as “iobacco-afﬁliared.” in your
statistical analysis of tacwrs relating to ~article conclusion~, did you determine the l
statistical effect of each of these ﬁve authorship criteria separately and in groups of 1
two, three and touri it so, would you kindly provide the results or those analyses:
Third, yuu stale that ”of the 106 articles considered in our study, 77% failed to
disclose the sources of funding for the research." Would you please tell us what
percentage did not disclose lundlng sources, broken dawn by the four matrix N
entries/classiﬁcations in your Table 3? g
