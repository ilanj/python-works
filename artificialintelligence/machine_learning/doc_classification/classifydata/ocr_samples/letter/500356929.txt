I This summarizes the key points 1 took away from the w" focus group

. sessions conducted in Miami on January 15 and 19. The final report

will be issued within the next few weeks.

r

: Essentially, the objectives of the sessions were:

V 1. To gain a better understanding of the smkers' problems which

k“ relate to aftertaste and smcker's breath;

E 2. to get censumcrs' reaction to the current “1" concept so we

7 can make modiﬁcations, if necessary, prior to fielding the

, major concept/usage stucy scheduled in mid—February; and

~ so To obtain early insights about the current product prototypes-

aoility to deliver against the. concept“

. The sessions involved (our younqradult groups: (1) His“ menthol
smokers (male/female), (2) full flavor male menthol smokers, (3) full
flavor female menthol smokers, and (4) male non—menthol smokers (full
flavor and Hi-ri).

I Ar aftertaste/Smokcr's Bream

, 1t appears that aftertaste is a common problem, particularly

among menthol smokers. They describe the problem as “dry,"

: "stale," "bitter," and "terrible feeling in their mouth."

- host of the smokers claim to notice the problem after smoking

- S~10 cigarettes and think ii. is most pronounced when they Wake

! up in the morningi To help solve this problem, smokers try

I various things, from chewing gum to using a mouthwashi

1 similarly, smoker‘s creath appears to he a major problem for

, both menthol and n0n>menthul smokers. In fact, they seem very

1 conscious about it, particularly in the presence of non-smokers.

1 Some term it as "guilt complex" and admit to doing something

, (having Certs, chewing gum, brushing teeth, etc.) before start—

; ing a convexsatlcn with close friends, inﬂows, wife/husband

‘ who are known non-smokers. Further, they seem to differentiake

1 bad breath from smoker's breath, the latter being viewed as

\ something all smokers have This differentiation is very

, interesting as this will probably help lessen the risk of

;, product over—promise with ”Y.“
