it is believed that the proposal as outlined by the agency should t
be rejected for the following reasons: 9,14
l. The program targets to an elderly audience which is
contrary to current marketing efforts for the brand.
In addition, if we assume that the primary appeal for this
type of program would be among those so years old and
over, he would he appealing to a group of people less -
mohile than the population at large, less prone towards
going out in the evening, and less able to afford a
sd-ss per couple expenditure for an evening's entertainment.
2. lt is believed that young adults would not he very
receptive to this type of program. while there is a
nostalgia orientation among young adults today, this
v nostalgia orientation is more toward rock music of the
mld~50's and are rather than ballroom and Dixieland
music from the 30‘s.
3.‘ unlike other special events opportunities that the
Brand Group has evaluated, the promoter of the "CAME!-
CARAVAN“ Revival retains no responsibility for making
_ the program a financial success. The arand would be
responsible for all promotional activities for each
show. In addition, the promoter would absorb all profits
from successful concerts while the brand would atsorh _
all losses from unsuccessful concerts. The financial
liability is great because the concerts would need on the \
average 8,500 people per concert in order to self-
liquidate. If this large attendance figura were to be
sustained for all concerts, it would probably necessitate
heavy advertising Suppﬂlt.
In sunrnary, the concept as presented does not appear economically
justifiable, nor does it conform to our current direction of
presenting a more modern stance in the marketplace.
