Re: SALEM Lights Vending nggrdm
Recommendation
This recommends a second half 1975 vending program in
support of SALEM Lights. The program, which would begin
Septmber 5, 1575, and terminate December 31, would
involve the following combination offer:
l. A 51.50 bonus payment offer (one-time only) to
vendors for placement of SALEM Lights in vending
machines. The offer would be available nationally.
2. A $1.Lm payment offer to vendors for placement
of a riser card on top of vending machinesu
The riser card would carry a consumer incentive

an area representing 25\ of the ms. in order
to evaluate this new vending incentive on a
“test" basis.
Thus. in areas where hath the honus payment offer and the
riaer card offer are available. the vendor could receive
a total of $2450.
‘ total cost of the program is estimated at 59m (see
attached cost analysis). Assuming the program generates
in}! additional placements (based on 1975 WINSTON Lights
vending experience) and assuming realistie weekly vending
sales for SALEM Lights (2 packs per week per machine), the
program would generate an estimated $123,000 additional
marginal contribution to the brand in 1975. and therefore.
would payout this year.
Funding it available within sum-a 1975 Sales promotion
