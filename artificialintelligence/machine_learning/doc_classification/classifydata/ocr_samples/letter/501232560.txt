Re: BRAND NAME QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
The following summarizes my thoughts on last week's one-nn—one
consumer interviews in Atlantar Most of what I heard can be
grouped into two broad areas.
o brand Imageéseﬂentaticn
o social Pressure
These two areas influence each other and together, go a long way
toward explaining behavior in the cigarette marker“
Brand Imageésemntation
The first issue in this area is to understand why brand name is
s the most important factor influencing consumer behaviorl Based
on what I observed in Atlanta, the evidence suggests the follow—
ing:
1. brand name operates more as a perceptual bias of
consumers than as a decision precess-~a WINSTON
smoker would eerct that mus-mu Lights is better
than ilarlhoro Lights or Merit.
' 2. The relative strength/taste perception of a spin»
off is based on that of its parent——"CAMEL Lights
' is probably stronger than Marlboro Lights because
CAMEL is stronger than Marlboro".
3. User imagery of a parent brand is probably not
transferred to the spin-off except in relative
terms. Low tar styles are not going to be as
masculine as full flavor parents because they
are weaker tastingﬂ-a 1 mg. mus-mu smoker would
probably be considered as a "wimp" for smoking
a hot air cigarette.
The second issue addresses: how do consumers segment brands?
and what do these segments mean? consumers were able to segment
brand families in a fairly consistent manner. The groupings of
brands is shown below. Different smokers described these segments ‘
differently: they talked about strong versus weak, full flavor a
versus low tar, men versus women, etc. Each of these factors is o ‘
highly correlated and supportive of the other and I don't really ;; ‘
think it is important which ones are "causative" and which are «-
descriptive. bf
