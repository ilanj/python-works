RE: periodic Status Repnrts on Key Ran Programs ~
1 am pieased that your initiai "status Rzpnrt on Key m Programs"
has been found usefui and that there may he a desire to make it a
reguiar, periodic report.
iou ask=d that i consider and rcconnend nnat night he an appropriate
rzpurling frequency. from much past experience with similar reports,
1 suggest that this report be done guarteriy. ‘
we are deaiing here with strategic, iongererange prograns. as opposed
to short-range projects. hence the rate of significant progress cannot 1
he expected to be rapid. By reporting ouarteriy 1 wind expect that i
we wau'ld have significant progress to describe in many. out by no neans
an. areas each time. , 1
Mar: frequent reporting wou1d mean describing. each time, a very 1
few significant deyeiopinents, much rather triviai progress. and. in ‘
most cases. having to simpiy state that no reany tangible change has
occurred since the previous report. that wou'ld. in my viz-i, inpose
upon the time and patience of our Executive Management and wuuld ‘
obscure-rather than highiignt reai progress - - hence my recommendation
ior a quarteriy reporting frequency.
