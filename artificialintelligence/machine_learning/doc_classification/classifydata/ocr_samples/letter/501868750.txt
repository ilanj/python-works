Dear Bill
I have Again talked with Dr. Senkus concerning [ha
views of the Hiscunsin Alumni Rcsearch Foundation as to
afletoxln and particularly the Foundation's proposal (or
research he thls matter. Dr. Senkus again confirms that
thla potter has been thoroughly explored end thet there
1: no toundatlou for the assumptlorrs made by ncrse and
perhaps others lo the roundaclon. As you perhaps know,
nr. Senkue lh your absence today talked on the telephone
with have about this matter. If need be, Dl‘l Senkus
could again ulslt bone but thls would seem hardly
worthwhile.
Apparently nerse has been sold on the propaganda
advanced by Fergus and carll 1h thelr peper, a copy of
uhlch you sent me. As you know, these people were lnvolved
lu the Venture clgaxette matter uhlth was not successful.
Sincerely,
