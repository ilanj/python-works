Bruce Crawford called today to inform us that Ted Newlin has
' v been named to the Executive committee at 3350 and that he will
\ / replace E. z. Norris as the senior management representative

As a matter of information, it is my personal opinion that '
this change will represent a significant improvement in our
overall relationship.
1: there are any direct questions relevant to this situation,
i suggest that you contact Bruce Crawford directly in my absence.
