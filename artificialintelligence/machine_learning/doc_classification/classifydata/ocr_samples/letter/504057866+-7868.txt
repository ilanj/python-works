SUBJECT: Salem Spirit concert public Relations Plan
~ ' me: February 6, 1984
. Attached is the public relations plan for the salem spirit
‘ concert series. To date we have not developed a complete
tactical plan, frankly waiting until we had a fuller knwlsdge
of schedule and emphasiir At any rate. the objectives and
strategies would remain unchanged.
We are working at full tilt to get everything ready for this
Thursday's press xeception. I understand that alahama wants
to have a major news conference in New orleans and we will begin
working on that innediately.
As you knw, we are working with Greg Fowler as well as Marie
Ratliff of pale Horris' ofﬁce to try to get this program the
recognition it deserves. 1 think we will have a great deal
of success this year.
1 think it goes without saying that if salem is to get the
credit as sponaox, we at RJR will have to do our job. Alabama
- will look after themselves first and us second —— which is
natural and understandable. To that end, 1 have assigned
srenda Pollmer, who is also involved in other product publicity
activities, to assist with the Salem concert project this
year. David and i will continue to be involved but l believe
we can get added publicity with arenda's help.
1: you have additional questions. please let me known
