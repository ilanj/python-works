You and I, along with R. h. Sanders and the Brand, met with
the Agency this week to review "Real People" campaign
development progress toward the scheduled 8/15 meeting with
Mrl Long. in general, the Agency had not addressed the
Brand's specific direction regarding their situational
exploratory following our 7/14 meeting in New York, and the
results did not meet our expectationsl The Agency was
re-directed to develop a print pool which communicates the
essence of the copy strategy, addressing nine specific
"values” as outlined in previous direction
The Agency also presented a new graphic treatment for OOH
which improves Brand name registration while also giVing the
advertising a greater proprietary look. it was agreed that
they would proceed with OOH development in this format
while continuing to develop clear and simple user image
situations. it was also agreed that the copyline "Real
Taste for Real People" will he utilized in the con
executions and will also be adopted [or print adding a
descriptive title to the visual situation
