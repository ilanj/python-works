Dear Mr. natty:
He appreciate your interest in assisting GLRC to
qualify and participate as a second source supplier of the

to submit a proposal that. we feel will enable us On 1 best
effort basis to develop the capability to become a qualified
supplier of the basic carbon powder, and further to work
toward hroadening our participation to become a fully
integrated produCer/supplier of a certified finished product
that meets crotts and saunders Engineering specifications.
We propose to fully lhare with crotts and Saunders all
details or the tecnnology that is developed during this
proqrnmi
Please note that the near term COBCE, which include the
development effort, price of initial production char in
relatively small scale existing equipment and associated
capital expenditures will assist us in moving quickly toward
the goal of becoming an efficient, low-cost producer. The
timeirame suggested for initial production and micronized
(final) milling in the proposed new, dedicated stage 11
(1504 ton/year) facility can probably he accelerated on our
end, assuming that details of the Phase 1 development/Stage
1 Production proposal can be quickly resolved.
we are looking forward to your response to our initial
proposal. Please let us know it you require additional
information or clarification on the proposal.
