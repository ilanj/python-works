SUBJECT: Plasma Nicotine study: XE Prototypes
A. BACKGROUND: In 1957 and 1989, the Eiobehavicral Division conducted
studies of puffing/breathing behaviors and plasma nicotine concentrations
among smokers who smoked cigarettes with reduced 'tar' to nicotine ratios
(T/N). In the 1987 study, the Jew T/N ratios were achieved through the
addition of nicotine lev‘ulinate to the tobaCCD blend (Project GT). In
19E9, the low T/ll ratios were achieved via special tobacco blending
techniques (Project XGTL These studies provided data indicating that the
properties of the nicotine levulinate—treated cigarettes were quite
different from those of tgf XGT and commercially available cigarettes. The
present tests will furthe ”knowledge of plasma nicotine concentrations in V
humans who smoke cigarettes treated with nicotine levulinate and/or sodium
levullnate.
a: menu FOR HUMAN SUBJECTS: Human smoking characteristics, plasma
nicotine concentrations, and physiological responses following smoking can
only be obtained using human subjects.
C. SCIENTIFIC AFFAIRS REVIEW: The levels of nicotine levulinate to be
applied to the cigarettes used in this test have been approved for limited
testing (< 1.5a levulinic acid).
u. PRODUCTS: The products to be tested in the proposed study were _
presented to the HRRC by Dr. M. F. Dube on 10—23-90r we cigarettes will
be tested, identified as cigarettes "c" and "a" in the presentation to the
timer FTC yields of the two cigarettes to he tested appear in Table L
Cigarette C contains 2.123 (by weight of tobacco) nicotine levulinate
prepared in a 2:1 molar ratio of levulinic acid to nicotine. Cigarette E
contains 3.2” nicotine levulinate prepared in a 1:1 molar ratio. For hoth
Cigarettes, the nicotine lev‘ulinate was applied to the tobacco as casing.

Mi Subjects will be 12 male Caucasian volunteers recruited from the
local community by Bellamy Research, Incl All volunteers will have
participated in similar studies conducted in our laboratory within the past
a months. The study requires the subjects to participate in one, z-hour
