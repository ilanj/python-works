Dear claude:
We are sending you an 5 grams sample of nicotine tamate, identified
he CvAhZi A sample hie heeh sent cut for a w analysis, hm. elnce the
analysis remit may not he back before I leave for three weeks, I did want
to get you a sample or the pre‘paraclnn.
If nicotine forms a tomato in analogous IAshion with other alkeloide
1 have worked with, under the cohditiehe er preparetich it shmnld be:
. galletanmc acid. (5 nicutﬂne)
The gallotehnic acid used wee munch-oat NF ﬂurry grade. This has the
idealized composition of pehte-(digallyl) glucose, Each nicotine molecule
would bind to one digallyl moiety. Total molecular weight thcoreticilly
would be:
1701
+5(162.2)= an

and a theoretical 3 content or 5.581. (Wﬁmgm)
if you want more or thie, it would be easy for me to make aome. 1
have ample nicotine.
When we first dieoueaed this it was in the context or something that
could he used as a nicotine scurce in some kind or buccal product. Dosage
would need to be very low, or couree. Another question might be whether
this type or preparetien, or very low aqueous eoluhility emd men-volatile
at room temperature, might be eemething to incorporate ea a source of
nicotine in a Iveynthetien cigaxette. The tahnnte type or complex might
relnase nicotine with little decanpesitiuh of the alkaloid on heating below
eomtuetieh temperatures. l-ahnine normally are yrassnc in tobacco co tennic
acid, particularly in the small amount that would he user], would not pose m
a problem. :‘.
