- Dear Haywood,
|
, Thank you for your letter of 5th October which I
have read on my return to the office this week.
I understand from A] Low that the arrangements made
for their visit to Newcastle were excellent and the information
‘ provided by Jim Ingram and Imperial's management was extremely
helpful. i am most grateful to you for your assistance in
arranging this visit.
I believe that good progress is being made with
‘ regard to the Malaysian sample pragrsmme and that we should be
in a position to make a decision on this project by the end of
this year. By copy of this letter I am forwarding the draft
copies or the License Agreement and the Purchase Agreement to
‘ our Legal Department in Millbank for their examination and come
ment in the hope that we can resolve any legal technicalities
that might arise in the event that we proceed with the investment
in a G—13C Plant for Malaysia.
with kind regards,
. Yours sincereiy,
i ..
