M! Dallas and st. louis sales kides
M5.
In visiting the North Dallas district on hpril 22nd and 23rd, the
slums were going real well. The first day I rode with Terri
stone and the second was with sheila Lee. The root that 7»li did
not accept the product left the sales force with an oversupply of
81611“: to place in their cullsr It seemed to he favoring the
lounm styles more than the 55mm styles. some stores seemed to be
completely out of menthol ioomm uhila others seem to he out of
100mm nanvmenthol.
The Mystery shopper program seemed to he going veil. host clerks
were wearing their nuttcn and chimed to have won some money from
the program. Nos: of the payments seemed to no for the button and
not so much for the recommendation or HORIZON to competitive
smokers.
one piece of learning from this test is in regard to the chains
accepting the program for their individual stores. The chain
stores’ names were being keyed into the handheld at the division
ofﬁce, as stores participating in the program, before the salesmen
had a chance to get to the stores to deliver the huttons. he a
result, the Mystery shopper was going to these stores only to find
that the clerks had no buttons and knew nothing about the program.
In the future, 1 hope we can have the salesmen key in the stores as
they sell in the program. some stores, for example Exxon, sent
out the packets of buttons themselves and as a result, the clerks
received the buttons two weeks into the program.
There did seem to be some cements made regarding the attitude or
the actual Mystery shoppers. They did not seem to he very
comfortable in talking ahout the product it asked any product .,. 5
related questions. Apparently, they did not give the clerks much 3
chance to say anything before they told the clerks to not ring up o
the pack. l understand that the overrinqs were a problem and m
Andrew is aware of that. 3
