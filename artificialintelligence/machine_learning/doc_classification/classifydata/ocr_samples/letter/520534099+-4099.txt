The more i lieien lo smnkus 341055 the munh'y, (ha more oppnmmiky I see {or DORAL
to creole aslirne produri, especiauy alleronr oonversaiion lasi week regarding Virginia
Slims. Cleuly in me sduli female smoker oaiegory, mere are elm produei that do
quile well - Misty and sryle for savings smokers and ior full pxice smokers, the obvious
is Virginia Slim: and lo a smaller exiem Benson 6x Hodges and Capri. (I am excluding
Mme) Bur on «be surisce, it appears mar ilvere is a place io have a brand lliai can lake
over ilie savings oaiegory and ran than not into ine FP category of wow smokers wlio
are ready lo trade down to a lower priced brand.
There are several reasons why a slim produor would beworth reviewing:
1. “2,6 Mall female smoke“, smoke a Slims cigarette. 9096 of all slum smokers
are female.
2, Vixgixu’a Slims has very little cumpeﬁh'cn in iemrs ufa brand mar has a big
brand Image and iemaieoriemed pnsltinning. (Evidence shnws they are
evaluating ineir positioning u we speak and we olso knnwthelx franchise
skews older )
