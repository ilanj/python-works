, ’ "Addiction"
: \ some anti—smoking government officials anL nthers
have gone so far as to brand smoking A 'drug addiction."
This claim is clearly falser It has no more scientific
validity than statements by exercise Enthusiasts that they
are "addicted“ to running. cr the Surgeon General's recent
statement that video games are "addicting."
Vocal advocates of the claim that smoking is
"aidicting" concede that there is no scientific éemonsﬁra-
ticn cf «gs-g necessary element of addiction —- physical
dependence. 1h 1981, Dr. Jack Hennlncfield cf 1mm stated
that whether physielegicll dependence is an important factor
in snaking was cnly “suspected." (Henningfield, ct am,
1951)» Dr, William PDllin, Director of the National Insti»
tnee on Drug Abuse mum, testified before Congress that:
"Ielvidence is net ye: conclusive as to whether or no:
_ ' there is physinlogic dependence er whet sype of withdrawal
syndrame is associated with cigarette smokingr" (Pullxn
statement on May 5, 1953 befexe lthe Senate Committee on
Lzbux and Human Resources-)
The fact is that ever 33 mlllion people in this
ccuntry alone stepped smoking —- the overwhelming majority U!
on their own. This refutes clr‘ims of "addlctiunr' 'Aﬂd1tts,” . t;
unlike cigarette snekers, require ever increasing substance 58;
levels.“ ‘ 8
