Can cigarette smoke in the air cause disease in non-smokers?
That's an emotional question for smokers and non-smokers alike
So we’ll try to set the record straigit in the most direct way we know.
There is Iiltle evidence—and certainly nothing which proves
scientifically—[hat c'garette smoke causes disease among non-
smokers.
You don‘thave to take our word for it.
U.Sr Surgeon GeneralJulius B. Richmond—whowas no friend of
smoking—said in his 1979 Report: “Healthy nonsmokers exposed
to cigarette smoke have little or no physiologic response to the
smoke, and what response does occur may be due to psychological
factors."
5 And in the 1982 Report, Surgeon General C4 Everett Koop could
3 not conclude that passive smoking is a cause of cancer in non-
smokers
The director of the National Heart, Lungand Blood Institute, Dr.
Claude Leniant, has been one of the tobacco industry’s sharpest
critics Yet Dr. Lenﬁnt stated in 1980 (and we believe it remains true
today) that “the evidence that passive smoking ina general environ-
ment has health effects remains sparse. incomplete and sometimes
unconvincing."
We‘ve decided to speak out on passive smoking because there is
so much rumor and rhetoric on this subject today. And we intend to
continue. from time to time, to speak out on other topics of concern
to you and to LB.
Our cﬁtics may try to discredit these messages as self-serving.
In a sense, they will be right We will challenge allegations that are
unproven and attacks we think are unfounded. If that is self-serving, m
so be it. 3
The questions that surround smoking raise many important ﬂ
issues. We believe that you're entitled to hear all sides of these 53
controversies :
