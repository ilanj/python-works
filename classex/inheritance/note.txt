Execution of a derived class definition proceeds the same as for a base class. When the class object is constructed, the base class is
remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested attribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look
in the base class. This rule is applied recursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class.

a method of a base class that calls another method defined in the same base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it.
