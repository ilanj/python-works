A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long we don't exit.

This is the reason that built-in functions like id(), print() etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each
module creates its own global namespace.


    Function: Local namespace
    Module: global namespace
    built in namespace
