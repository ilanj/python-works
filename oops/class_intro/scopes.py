"""
The global statement is a declaration which holds for the entire current code block. It means that the listed identifiers are to be interpreted as globals.

The nonlocal statement causes the listed identifiers to refer to previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope excluding globals. This is important
 because the default behavior for binding is to search the local namespace first. The statement allows encapsulated code to rebind variables outside of the local
  scope besides the global (module) scope."""
