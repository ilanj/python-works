"""
Abstraction is an important aspect of object-oriented programming. In python, we can also perform data hiding by adding the double underscore (___)
as a prefix to the attribute which is to be hidden. After this, the attribute will not be visible outside of the class through the object.

class One:
    __a="a"
    b="b"
obj=One()
print(obj._One__a)
